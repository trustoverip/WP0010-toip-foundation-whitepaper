As is usually the case, their initial efforts focused primarily on proving out the technology side of the stack. But as these technical solutions started bearing fruit, customers began coming to the table looking for real-world solutions. That\u2019s when attention turned to the \u201cother half\u201d of the stack\u2014the practical governance and policy questions that must be answered in order to drive business, legal, and social acceptance. The result is the \u200b dual stack \u200b shown below. Whereas early versions of the ToIP stack reflected its historical origins \u2014 technology on the left followed by governance on the right \u2014 real-world experience soon taught us to reverse it. \u200b Governance first . In other words, implementing ToIP-based solutions should begin with\u200b business requirements \u200b, then move to \u200b policy requirements \u200b transparently communicated in governance frameworks. Only then should you choose the technology components required to implement those policies.","title":"Dual Stack Design"},{"location":"stack/layer1/","text":"The first two layers of the ToIP stack are designed to provide \u200b technical trust \u200b \u2014 the assurance that one machine can establish a secure, private connection with another machine. To do this using \u200b public key cryptography , you must be able to strongly verify the \u200b public key \u200b of the party you are connecting to. The W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification\u200b solves this problem without using centralized\u200b certificate authorities by standardizing how you can permanently identify and verify a public key stored on a blockchain or other distributed system. This solution gives rise to public utilities that serve as strong cryptographic roots-of-trust \u200b for the DIDs and public keys of verifiable credential issuers. ToIP Layer One utilities can be implemented using any technology that can provide the necessary trust assurances, e.g., blockchains (of any kind), distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed hash tables, and so on. Although technical trust is machine-to-machine, implementing technical trust still requires humans to design, code, test, and certify these systems. This is the job of Layer One utility governance frameworks\u200b that specify the policies under which a utility is implemented and operated such that it can be trusted by the higher layers.","title":"Layer One: Public Utilities"},{"location":"stack/layer2/","text":"If Layer One is about the strong cryptographic\u200b roots \u200b of technical trust, then Layer Two is about the \u200b branches \u2014 the digital wallets and digital agents needed to form secure, private peer-to-peer connections using either public DIDs (from Layer One) or\u200b peer DIDs\u200b . The latter are exchanged directly between the peers and never need to touch a blockchain \u2014 a significant advantage for both scalability and privacy. Just as the Internet Protocol (IP) forms the narrow waist of the TCP/IP stack that powers the Internet, the DIDComm protocol (currently a Working Group at the [Decentralized Identity Foundation]\u200b( https://identity.foundation/ ) forms the narrow waist of the ToIP stack. Again, although technical trust is machine-to-machine, how digital wallets and agents are actually implemented makes a tremendous difference not only to the security and privacy of users, but to their confidence that their personal data and credentials are truly portable and vendor-independent (unlike the proprietary digital wallets built into our smartphones today). This is the province of provider governance frameworks\u200b that can specify the privacy, security, and data protection standards against which hardware providers, software providers, and cloud hosting providers can be certified.","title":"Layer Two: Peer-to-Peer Protocol"},{"location":"stack/layer3/","text":"Layers Three and Four are where \u200b human trust\u200b is established and maintained.

This is the layer where issuers, holders, and verifiers exchange credentials and proofs using credential exchange protocols \u200b that run on top of DIDComm. Note that these are just one example of the kind of trusted data exchange protocols that can operate at Layer Three \u2014 many other types of secure messaging and workflow automation protocols can be implemented at this layer. On the governance half of the stack, Layer Three is where the governance trust triangle \u200b comes into full play. Almost any digital credential that will be issued by multiple issuers and/or accepted by a wide range of verifiers needs a \u200b credential governance framework\u200b . It will define what issuers will issue what credentials under what policies to what holders with what level(s) of assurance \u2014 and under what trust mark(s).

Layer Four is specifically designed to enable \u200b digital trust ecosystems \u200b \u2014 entire families of applications and credentials that are not only designed to interoperate technically, but which share a common \u200b ecosystem governance framework \u200b. This specifies the purpose, principles, and policies that apply to all governance authorities and govern- ance frameworks operating within that ecosystem \u2014 at all four layers of the ToIP stack. An ecosystem governance framework can enable nearly frictionless data exchange between apps, sites, and businesses while providing a consistent user experience of security, privacy, and data protection across the ecosystem that can be as important to consumer confidence as a consistent user experience of the controls for driving a car (steering wheel, gas pedal, brakes, turn signals) are to driver safety around the world.","title":"Layer Four: Application Ecosystems"},{"location":"trust/back_to_future/","text":"There are obvious reasons we didn\u2019t immediately port our long-established real-world trust model of physical credentials to the digital world.

Digital credentials are much harder. They were a bridge too far when the Internet was young. But now that is maturing, the benefits of introducing digital credentials would be enormous. Each of us could obtain credentials in a digital wallet just like we obtain physical credentials today. Imagine how much simpler the journey would be for a business owner like Sally, shown below. In step one she could obtain a digital license for her business. In step two she could take that credential to a bank to open a business bank account.

For example, this could include: A birth certificate issued by a hospital or vital statistics agency that proves when and where you were born and who were your parents. A business registration or license of any kind that proves you are authorized to conduct a specific type of business. A diploma issued by a university that proves you have an educational degree. A passport issued by a government of a country that proves you are a citizen. An official pilot\u2019s license that proves you can fly a plane.

As this diagram suggests, digital governance frameworks are the backbone of this new era of digital trust. Every digital credential in your wallet should be backed by a governance framework that spells out the business, legal, and technical rules under which that credential operates.

In these governance trust triangles, the government itself is the governance authority, the laws and regulations of the country are the governance framework, and the issuers are the various government services authorized to issue a specific type of credential. Citizens or businesses can obtain the credentials for which they are qualified and then present them to any relying service that trusts the government for the accuracy of the information on the credential. Example: Payment Card Networks \u00b6 Another widely-known example of the governance trust triangle is a payment card network like Mastercard. In this case, the governance authority is Mastercard; the issuers are the banks and credit unions in the Mastercard network; the holders are the individuals or businesses that apply for Mastercards; and the verifiers are merchants enrolled in the Mastercard network to accept payment cards as shown below.

Holders request credentials from issuers, hold them in their wallets or filing cabinets, and present them when requested by verifiers (and approved by the holder). Although we most commonly think of individuals as holders, holders can also be organizations, or even things (such as the registration for a car). Verifiers can be anyone seeking trust assurance of some kind about the holder of a credential. Verifiers request the credentials they need and then follow their own policy to verify their authenticity and validity.

No intermediaries needed. No server integration needed. Every peer forms trust relationships directly with every other peer. Each peer determines its own policies for trusting another peer. This, ironically, is exactly how the trust model for real-world credentials work. Each peer is a holder of its own credentials and a verifier of another peer\u2019s credentials. Any peer can be an issuer of credentials when needed. This is the root cause of our trust gap.

First the issuer writes a Decentralized Identifier (DID) together with its public key (and any other cryptographic material needed for the issuer\u2019s verifiable credentials) to a blockchain (or other sufficiently trusted public utility). Second, the issuer uses its private key to digitally sign a verifiable credential it issues to a qualified holder, who stores it in her own digital wallet.

Since the proofs contain the issuer\u2019s DID, the verifier uses it to read the issuer\u2019s public key and other cryptographic data from the blockchain. In the final step, the verifier uses the issuer\u2019s public key to verify that the proofs are valid and that the digital credential has not been tampered with.","title":"Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle"}]}
